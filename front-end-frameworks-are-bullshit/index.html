# JS Frameworks Are Bullshit
### Go butt-naked-native instead

class: center, middle

# Expectations
### This is a rant

---

class: center, middle

# Goal
### Trolling (for good)

---

class: center, middle, green

# A White Lie We Tell Ourselves
### "front-end apps are complex therefore I need a framework"

---

class: center, middle, green

# But secretly our nerdy little hearts go: 

### "Yay I get to use new technology #nerd-love"

---

class: center, middle, green

# So we marry a framework: 

### "Man **Angular.js** is the shit!!! I do"

---

class: center, middle, green

# 6 months later...
### "I finally understand: scopes, filters, services, Angular's DI, directives & transclusion!"

---

class: center, middle, red

# A day later...

### "Damn! React.js is the new shit, I'm stuck on Angular"

---

class: center, middle, green

# So what do you do?

### Dump Angular.js & move to React.js on InDay!!!

# Can you use your Angular.js shit with your React.js shit?

### No, at least not easily

# Can you leverage what you learned with Angular.js in React.js?

### No, at least not directly

# You Have 2 Choices

###  1. Stick it out & go down with the ship (doomed to legacy)

# 3 Common Reasons For JS Frameworks

1. Data binding
2. Templating
3. Widgets

---

# 3 Common ~~Reasons~~ Excuses For JS Frameworks

1. Data binding
2. Templating
3. Widgets

---

class: center, middle, green

# All Are Bullshit

### I'll walk through why for each one
---

class: center, middle, green

# Common Excuse #1: Data Binding

### When my JS domain object changes, update my form field
---

# Frameworks Use 3 Primary Methods Today

1. Dirty checking (Angular 1x)
2. Virtual DOM diffing (React)
3. Explicit linking (Ember)

---

class: center, middle

# The thing is

### Data binding is now easy in vanilla JS

---

class: center, middle, green

# Enter Object.observe

### When a property changes, tell me
---

```javascript
var todoModel = { name: "Stop using BS frameworks", state: "tragic" }

function observer(changeStream) { 
  changeStream.forEach(function(change) {
    console.log(change)
  })
}

Object.observe(todoModel, observer)

todoModel.state = "hopeful"

// Object {type: "update", object: Object, name: "state", oldValue: "tragic"}
```
---

class: center, middle

# Can mux changes from multiple objects into single stream too
---

```javascript
var todoModel = { name: "Stop using BS frameworks", state: "tragic" }
var userModel = { name: "Tom", tier: "free" }

function observer(changeStream) { 
  updateDOM(changeStream) 
}

Object.observe(todoModel, observer)
Object.observe(projectModel, observer)

// observe gets changes from both objects in same stream
todoModel.state = "hopeful"
userModel.tier = "moocher"

```
---

# Also Easy To:
1. Only listen to the events you care about (changed, added, deleted etc.)
2. Send notifications off of arbitrary functions (see notify())
3 . Hide changes from observers, ex: if you were going to make lots of changes at once, then do a single update (see performChange())

---

class: center, middle

# Hey You cheated!!

### That's 1 way data binding. I want bi-directional
---

class: center, middle, green

# Enter: Mutation Observers

### When the DOM changes, tell me
---

```javascript
var target = document.querySelector('#some-id')
 
var observer = new MutationObserver(function(changeStream) {
  // same as before
})
 
var config = { attributes: true, ... }
observer.observe(target, config)
```

---

class: center, middle, green

# Full example

### 2 way data binding
---

```javascript

function bindModelToView(obj, property, domElm) {
  Object.observe(obj, function(changes) {
    changes
      .filter(function(c) { return c.name == property })
      .forEach(function(c) {
        domElm.text(c[property])
      })
  })
}

function bindViewToModel(obj, property, domElm) {
  var observer = new MutationObserver(function(chagnes) {
    mutations
    .forEach(function(mutation) {
      obj[property] = domElm.text
    })
  })

  observer.observe(domElm, { attributes: true })
}
```

# Do I expect you to implement data-binding?

### No, you can use a **micro** library. Point is you don't need a huge framework
---

# 3 Common ~~Reasons~~ Excuses For JS Frameworks

1. ~~Data binding~~
2. Templating
3. Widgets

---

class: center, middle, green

# Common Excuse #2: Templating

### Goal: Reuse markup (ex list of  comments)
---

class: center, middle 

# Enter: HTML5 &laquo;template&raquo; tag

### Yes it's real
---

```html
<html>
  <head>
   ...
  </head>

  <body>
 <!-- Does not appear in the DOM & has no side effects: images & scripts don't run within this tag...yet  --> 
   <template id="commentTemplate">
      <section class="comment">
        <img class="avatar" src="" />
        <p class="message-text"></p>
      </section>
   </template>


 </body>
```

```javascript
var template = document.querySelector('#commentTemplate').content
template.querySelector('img').src = '/avatars/josh.png'

var clone = document.importNode(template, true)
document.body.appendChild(clone) // now the image loads
```
---

# 3 Common ~~Reasons~~ Excuses For JS Frameworks

1. ~~Data binding~~
2. ~~Templating~~
3. Widgets

---

class: center, middle, green

# Common Excuse #3: Widgets  

### I want reusable components across my web-app
---

class: center, middle

# Enter: web-components  

### Native, reusable widgets. You can use with any framework 
---

# The Basics:

#### Custom Elements

- Create your own HTML tags, for example: &laquo;line-chart&raquo; (Custom Elements)
-  They can have their own APIS

#### Custom Events

- Allow your custom components to send/recieve data via custom defined events (works just like clicks)

#### Shadow DOM

- Encapsulation: JS and CSS doesn't leak out (kinda like an iframe) 

#### Imports
 - Reusability/sharing via HTML5 imports 
---

# Why They Destroy Frameworks:

1. **Native & standardized:** No insitutional knowledge required to build or use them.
2. **No lock-in:** any front end app can use them - it's just HTML/JS/CSS
3. **Loosely coupled:** you can mix and match your favorites
---

# Big Picture App:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="import" href="/my-componenet-library.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <calendar-select data-name="Start"></calendar-select>
    <calendar-select data-name="End"></calendar-select>
    <button>Submit</button>

    <line-chart></line-chart>

    <metric-table></metric-table>
  </body>
</html>
```

1. Each component has its own API via attributes
2. Each component has its own API via JS, ex startDate.getDate()
2. Each component encapsulates its own HTML/CSS/JS methods & behavior (called Shadow DOM)

# Creating Your Own Components

### Really quickly

---

### Register your new element

```javascript
var LineChart = document.registerElement('line-chart')
```

### Add it to the DOM

```javascript
document.appendChild(new LineChart()) // or
document.appendChild(document.createElement('line-chart'))
```

### Or just instantiate via HTML

```html
 <line-chart></line-chart>
```

---

class: center, middle

# Adding Functionality

---

### Give your component some api methods: 

```javascript
var LineChart = document.registerElement('line-chart', {
  prototype: Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype, {
    data: {
      get: function() { return this._data }
      set: function(data) { this._data = data }
    },

    updateDataFromUrl: function(url) {
      get(url, this.data.set) // make an Ajax call & set the data
    }
  })
})
```

---

class: center, middle

# Passing Data Around
### Using custom events

---

### Create & Fire Your Own Custom Event: 

```javascript
var ChartUpdated = new CustomEvent("chartUpdated", {
	detail: {
		dateTime: new Date()
	}
});

var LineChart = document.registerElement('line-chart', {
  prototype: Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype, {
    updateDataFromUrl: function(url) {
      // ...
      myElement.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
    }
  })
})

document.addEventListener('chartUpdated', function(e) {
  console.log(e.dateTime)
})
```

---

### Best Practices:

1. Use data-xxx attributes or plain JS methods to pass config/data to your custom widgets
2. Use custom events for sending data out of a widget (remember their internal DOM is hidden from the outside)
3. Use imports to organize your HTML/CSS/JS dependencies

# Now Back To My Rant: Why JS Frameworks?
---

# Good Reasons To Use JS Frameworks: 

### You like imprisoning code
After all it's much too small to be left outside by itself

### Reimplementing date select widgets again and again sounds fun
After all code katas are important to your developer growth

### You think preventing other people from using your widgets, is helping them
Devs clearly should do more code katas so they can pass the LI interview questions 
---

class: center, middle

# Go But Naked Native Instead
### web-components + imports + object.observe
---

# Good Reasons To Go Native: 

### You can upgrade incrementally
Widgets are encapsulated, if a new JS feature comes out - just update 1 at a time.

### You can *actually* reuse your widgets
Writing a new app? You can just drop in your calendar select widget. It's native - JS & the apis aren't going away for a long time

### Other people can *actually* reuse your widgets 
No matter what framework they are in, they can use them
---

class: center, middle
# Wrapping Up
### Almost there!
---

class: center, middle
# JS Frameworks encourage monolithic apps
### It's difficult to separate pieces you like
---

class: center, middle
# Web components encourage micro-services
### They are decoupled, each do a single thing well are easy to change & share
---

class: center, middle
# Your Favorite Framework Is a Sinking Ship
### Eventually it will be a wreck
---

class: center, middle
# Native JS/HTML/CSS is here to stay
### It's not going anywhere
---

class: center, middle
# How would you like to spend your time? 
---

class: center, middle
# Learning the latest framework?
### Where your knowledge will be mostly useless in 6 months Or... 
---

class: center, middle
# Learning native JS/HTML/CSS 
### Where you can directly re-use what you learned on your last project, today
---

class: center, middle
# Over time you can learn N frameworks
### Or reap compounding benefits from learning the native platform
---

class: center, middle
# You can even use that saved time to write unit tests 
### Because even in 2015 people still don't write them for front-end code...WTF
---

class: center, middle
# Let Your Code Be Free, Go Native
### The End
